                                </h2>
                                <h5>by Jane Austen</h5>
                                “Beware how you give your heart.”
Northanger Abbey is a coming-of-age satirical novel, which pokes fun at the 18th century British genteel.
Seventeen-year-old Catherine Morland is excessively fond of reading Gothic novels. She is invited by the Allens to spend a season in Bath and participate in balls and the theatre. Soon enough, she meets the intriguing and wealthy Henry Tilney, with whom she engages in conversation and frivolity. Her over-active imagination leads her to expect mystery and intrigue at every turn. However, the truth turns out to be far more complicated. Deliciously witty in its portrayal of love, Northanger Abbey is one of Jane Austen's most endearing classics.

                                Engulfed in revenge and murder, Hamlet is the tale of a son’s quest for his father’s murderer while losing himself to disillusionment. Shakespeare’s writing inspires young minds to contemplate concepts represented by the comic interplay of wise characters, emotional conflicts, and fatal realities. The tale has been retold using simple language and beautiful illustrations to make it easier for the kids to grasp and enjoy. The book also has interesting, application-based and memory-based questions, along with an introduction to the themes in the story for better understanding.

                                <h5>by J.R.R Tolkien</h5>
                                The Fellowship of the Ring is the first of the three volumes that comprise The Lord of the Rings novel. Set in a mythical universe of Middle-earth, this book continues in the same tone as The Hobbit. The Dark Lord, Sauron, is the Lord of the Rings, who is on a mission to reclaim the One Ring and use it to enslave all of Middle-earth.

The Fellowship Of The Ring commences with a birthday party in Hobbiton. Bilbo Baggins, the current possessor of the Ring, turns 111 and bequeaths the ring to his cousin, Frodo Baggins. Several years pass and the wizard Gandalf routinely visits Frodo in Bag End. One spring night, he tells Frodo the truth about the Ring and the story behind it. He informs him that Sauron has risen again and is in search of the Ring. Upon learning this, Frodo departs from the Shire alongside three Hobbit friends: Sam, Merry and Pippin.

Along the way, the four of them are faced with several obstacles and distractions, including Ringwraiths, who are the servants of Sauron, a malevolent willow tree and an evil tomb ghost. The group befriends wandering Elves on the way and set upon their path across Middle-earth to the Cracks of Doom, intending to destroy the Ring and foil the Dark Lords plan.

                                <h5>by George Orwell</h5>  
                                1984: A Novel, unleashes a unique plot as per which No One is Safe or Free. No place is safe to run or even hide from a dominating party leader, Big Brother, who is considered equal to God. This is a situation where everything is owned by the State. The world was seeing the ruins of World War II. Leaders such as Hitler, Stalin and Mussolini prevailed during this phase. Big Brother is always watching your actions. He even controls everyone’s feelings of love, to live and to discover. The basic plot of this historic novel revolves around the concept that no person has freedom to live life on his or her own terms. The present day is 1984.

The whole world is gradually changing. The nations which enjoy freedom, have distorted into unpleasant and degraded places, in turn creating a powerful cartel known as Oceania. This is the world where the Big Brother controls everything. There is another character Winston Smith, who is leading a normal layman life under these harsh circumstances, though hating all of this. He works on writing the old newspaper articles in order to make history or past relevant to today’s party line.

He is efficient enough in spite of hating his bosses. Julia, a young girl who is morally very rigid comes into the fore. She too hates the system as much as Winston does. Gradually, they get into an affair but have to conceal their feelings for each other, as it will not be acceptable by Big Brother. In Big Brother’s bad world, freedom is slavery and ignorance is strength.

He attended school at Dartmouth and Harvard, worked in a mill, taught, and took up farming, before he moved to England, where his first books of poetry, A Boy’s Will (1913) and North of Boston (1914), were published. North of Boston brought him recognition as the preeminent voice of New England and as one of America’s major poets. In 1915 he returned to the United States and settled on a farm in New Hampshire. Four volumes of his poetry, New Hampshire (1923), Collected Poems (1930), A Further Range (1936), and A Witness Tree (1942) were all awarded the Pulitzer Prize. He died in 1963.
